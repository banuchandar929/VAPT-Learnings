#Authentication : is a process of verifying the identity of the user
#Authorization: granting or denying access

Authentication follows some mechanisms:

-- something you know : what we know to authenticate to the website to tell the server.
eg: username and password, security questions, pin
the things only we know no one else knows.

-- something you have : authenticating with what we have, "like we need to have physical devices" to get OTP, mobile device, cards, RSA token.

-- something you are : authenticating with our fingerprints, eye scan, face recognition, walking patterns, voice recognision.

-- atleast we need to maintain any of the above two mechanisms, so that the application will be secure.

**"Breaking this authentication patterns are called BROKEN AUTHENTICATION."
